# PWA Example

This is a project for me to teach myself about developing a PWA.
PWAs are cool because they allow normal websites to be installed onto 
a mobile device like a native app.

The base of the project was taken from this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-pwa-from-scratch-with-html-css-and-javascript/).
